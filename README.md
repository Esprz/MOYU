## MOYU

This is an App used to provide a convenient platform for exchanging idle tutorial books, aimed to promote unused book exchanges, helping reduce the waste of books in student groups. 

Since this APP now is only released for students in our school, and register for this app requires strict id authentication .

please use the following account and password to login our app directly(so that you can skip the registration part)
